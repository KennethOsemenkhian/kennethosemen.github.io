                  <p>
                    For a beginner, there are a few drones that stand out on this list, but the drone you get heavily depends on what kind of beginner you are. If you’re looking at getting into drones because you like flying things and you want something to learn on, the Bugs 3 is a great choice. If you’re just looking for something to fly for fun around the house and bash around, you will probably want to look at the Mambo FPV.

                <p>
                  Most drones are pretty easy to fly, but the controls will be slightly different depending on what kind of drone you get. Camera drones are the easiest drones to fly, while toy drones can be harder (because of their lack of sensors and flying aids). To fly a camera drone, people usually use a controller with their smartphone attached to it. The smartphone will let you see a live video feed and all of the most important flight data you need. Some drones like the DJI Mavic Pro, DJI Spark, and Yuneec breeze allow you to fly just using your smartphone.

                  All drones that have 4 rotors (quadcopters) will have 4 main controls spread between two joysticks, Sometimes, the joysticks can have custom mappings, but most will be set with the throttle and yaw (move up/down and rotate left/right ) on the left joystick. The Right joystick will then control the forward/backward movement and left/right movement.

                <p>
                  If you’re looking for quality, the Inspire 2 is the best camera drone you can buy that comes ready to fly out of the box. The next best option is the Phantom 4 Pro and after that, the Mavic Pro. If you’re concerned about video quality, just pick one of the three drones mentioned above (which ever one matches your price point) and you’ll be more than satisfied. There are really no other drones that come close to what these three can do. Some people who shoot videos for a living will buy the Mavic Pro, Phantom 4 Pro, and the Inspire 2, because each of them can be useful for different situations.

              <p>
                The main difference between a camera drone and a toy drone, is that camera drones are capable of recording videos and images that are worth putting on the internet. Toy drones can’t capture good videos or photos because they lack high quality components like gimbals for stabilization, or fast image processors for capturing high resolution video.

                Camera drones usually have more flight time, better range, better video quality, better image quality, and more autonomous features. This makes them much more expensive, but at the end of the day, you get what you’re paying for.

              <p>
                Registering is easy. If you have a toy drone, you probably don’t need to register it, but for those of you buying camera drones, here’s how it works. You just fill out a few important questions like what model drone you have, where you live, and your email address. Then you pay a small license fee, print out your new registration number, and attach it to your drone in a place where it can be seen.

              <p>
                The main thing that you will need is a relatively new IOS or android device. Usually you can use any iPad or iPhone made in the last 3 years. However, some drones don’t have controllers that were designed to hold tablets, so keep that in mind. If you’re buying the bugs 3, you won’t need a smartphone since it doesn’t have a built-in camera that you can control. All of the drones in this list come with batteries, chargers, controllers (if needed), extra propellers, and anything else you might need to go for your first flight.

              <p>
                The word “drone” has taken on a few different meanings over the years. Some people think of a drone as a bee, others might think of those predator drones that the military uses. The drones that most people talk about today are simply radio controlled aircraft that have some level of autonomous features. A drone can be a plane, a helicopter, a quadcopter, or any combination in-between. Most of the drones sold today are quadcopters. They have 4 rotors and a flight controller that is used to stabilize the lift from the each propeller.

              <p>
                Not all drones have cameras, but most do. All camera drones have cameras built into them, but most toy drones don’t have cameras. You should also consider that the cameras on toy drones are not equal to the cameras found on a true camera drone. Toy drones are not capable of recording high quality video or images.
